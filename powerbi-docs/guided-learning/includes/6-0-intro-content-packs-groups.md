Welcome to the **Publishing and Sharing** section of the **Guided Learning** course for Power BI.

Now that you've learned how Excel and Power BI work seamlessly together, and you've learned all about the visuals you can create in reports and dashboards, you likely want to share them with your coworkers and friends. With Power BI, **publishing and sharing** are easy to accomplish.

## Share and collaborate with colleagues in Power BI
*Get introduced to the tools that make sharing and collaborating easier with Power BI*

In this module, we cover the various ways Power BI offers for sharing and collaborating with your colleagues on your dashboards, reports, and data. For example, you can:

* *Publish your reports* from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service
* Use *Power BI mobile* apps to view and interact with reports and dashboards
* Create *Content packs* that package up a dashboard, report, and dataset to send to your colleagues. They can use it as a starting point and further enhance it.
* Create *Groups*, which you can use as a security model to identify a subset of users who have access to dashboards, reports, and datasets you create.

Throughout much of this module we use the scenario of setting up a new finance group. We'll show how to set up the group, share dashboards, reports, and datasets into the group, and add members who'll have access to the items in the group.
