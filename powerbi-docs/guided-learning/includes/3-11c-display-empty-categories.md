By default, column headings are only displayed in your reports if they contain data. For example, if you were displaying revenue by country and had no sales in Norway, then Norway would not appear anywhere in your visualization.

To display empty categories, click on the down-arrow in the field you want to change in the  **Visualizations** pane, and select **Show items with no data**.

Any empty columns now appear in your visual with blank values.

Once you select **Show items with no data** for any field in the **Visualizations** pane, it applies to all fields displayed in the Visualizations pane. So if you add another field, any items that have no data will also be shown, without having to revisit the drop-down menu.
