Sometimes you may want to bring a printed report or dashboard to a meeting, or so you can share it with others. With Power BI, there are a few ways you can make printouts of your visuals.

In the Power BI service, select the ellipses (three dots) in the top-right side of the service, and select **Print dashboard**.

A **Print** dialog appears, where you can select the printer to which you want to send the dashboard, as well as standard print options such as *portrait* or *landscape* orientation.

## Export data from a visual
You can also export the data from any visual in the Power BI service. Just select the ellipses on any visual, and then select the **Export data** button (the middle button). When you do so, a .CSV file is created and downloaded to your local computer, and a message appears on your browser (just like any other browser-initiated download) letting you know the download is complete.

You can also print or export directly from a report. When viewing a report in the Power BI service, select **File > Print** to open the print dialog.

And just like with a dashboard, you can export data from a visual within a report, too, by selecting the export button on a visual.
