Welcome to the **Power BI and Excel** section of the **Guided Learning** course for Power BI.

Chances are good that you've used **Excel** before. Maybe you used Excel to create or view reports, or to build pie charts or other visuals. Or maybe you used **Power Pivot** or **Power Query** to build solutions that were a bit more technical. If so, you'll be right at home in Power BI, and so will your workbooks.

This section shows you just how easy it is to bring Excel workbooks into Power BI, and demonstrates that Power BI and Excel make a great partnership.

The following topics guide you through uploading an Excel workbook with a simple table into Power BI. Then you see how to upload workbooks created with Excel's more advanced BI data modeling and reporting features, such as Power Pivot and Power View.

You'll also learn some benefits of saving your Excel workbook files to OneDrive for Business. When you connect to Excel files on OneDrive from Power BI, your reports and dashboards in Power BI are updated and refreshed automatically when you make changes and save your work.
