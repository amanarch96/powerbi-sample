Once you've built a dashboard, you can edit its **Tiles* in the Power BI service to make a few formatting changes.

To make changes to a tile, hover over the tile and select the ellipses (three dots) to show a collection of icons that allow you to make changes to the tile.

Select the **pen** icon to open the **Tile Details** pane. From here you can change the tile's **Title**, **Subtitle**, include its last refresh time and date, and other details such as creating a custom link.

By default, when you click on a dashboard tile you are taken to the report from which it originated. To change this behavior, use the **Set custom link** field in the **Tile Details** pane. One popular use of this feature is to take users to the organization homepage when clicking on a logo image.

## Add widgets to your dashboard
You can also add widgets to your dashboard. A **widget** is a special dashboard tile that, instead of containing a visualization, contains other items such as an image, an online video, a text box, or rich web content.

When you select the Add Widget link in the upper-right corner of a Dashboard, the **Add a widget** dialog appears.

When you add a text box, for example, a **Tile details** pane appears on the right side, where you can edit details similar what is available when editing the details of any tile. But with widgets, there's also a section to define or modify the widget content, such as a rich text editor for a text box.

With widgets and the ability to edit tile details, you can customize your dashboard and make it look just how you want it to be.
