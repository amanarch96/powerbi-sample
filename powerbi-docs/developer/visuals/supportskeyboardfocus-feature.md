# Use the supportsKeyboardFocus feature

This article describes how to use the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature in Power BI visuals.
The `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature allows navigating the data points of the visual using the keyboard only.

To learn more about keyboard navigation for visuals, see [Keyboard Navigation](../../create-reports/desktop-accessibility-consuming-tools.md#keyboard-navigation).

## Example

Open a visual that uses the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature. Select any data point within the visual and select tab. The focus moves to the next data point for each time you select tab. Select enter to select the highlighted data point.

## Requirements

This feature requires API v2.1.0 or higher.

This feature can be applied to all visuals except image visuals.

## Usage

To use the `supportsKeyboardFocus` feature, add the following code to the *capabilities.json* file of your visual.
This capability allows the visual to receive focus through keyboard navigation.

```json
    {   
            ...
        "supportsKeyboardFocus": true
            ...
    }

```
