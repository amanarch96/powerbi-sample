# How to build a high performance Power BI visual
This article will cover techniques on how a developer can achieve high performance when rendering visuals. 

No one wants a visual to take its time when rendering and squeezing every drop of performance you can out of code becomes critical when rendering. 

> [!NOTE]
> As we continue to improve and enhance the platform, new versions of the API are constantly being released. In order to get the most out of the Power BI visuals' platform and feature set, it's recommended you keep up-to-date with the most recent version.
>
> Since the latest **version 2.1**, Power BI visual load times have improved on average by 20%.

## Power BI visual performance tips
Here are some recommendations on how to achieve optimal visual performance. 

### Use User Timing API
Using the **User Timing API** to measure your app's JavaScript performance can help you decide which parts of the script need optimization.

For more information, see the [User Timing API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh772738(v=vs.85).aspx).

### Review animation loops
Does the animation loop redraw unchanged elements? 

 - Problem: It wastes time to draw elements that don’t change from frame-to-frame.

 - Solution: Update frames selectively. 
 
When the time comes to animate static visualizations, it’s tempting to lump draw code into one update function and repeatedly call it with new data for each iteration of the animation loop.

Instead consider the following update pattern, use a visual constructor method to draw everything static, then the update function only needs to draw visualization elements that change. 

   > [!TIP]
   > Inefficient animation loops are commonly found in axes and legends.

### Cache DOM Nodes 
When a node or list of nodes is retrieved from the DOM, you need to think about whether you can reuse them in later computations (sometimes even the next loop iteration). As long as you don't need to add or delete additional nodes in the relevant area, caching them can improve your application's overall efficiency.

To make sure that your code is fast and doesn’t slow down the browser, keep DOM access to a minimum. 

- Before: 

   ```javascript
   public update(options: VisualUpdateOptions) { 
       let axis = $(".axis"); 
   }
   ```

- After: 

   ```javascript
   public constructor(options: VisualConstructorOptions) { 
       this.$root = $(options.element); 
       this.xAxis = this.$root.find(".xAxis"); 
   } 
 
   public update(options: VisualUpdateOptions) { 
       let axis = this.axis; 
   }
   ```

### Avoid DOM manipulation 
Limit DOM manipulation as much as possible.  Insert operations like `prepend()`, `append()`, and `after()` are time-consuming and shouldn't be used unless necessary.

For instance:

  ```javascript
  for (let i=0; i<1000; i++) { 
      $('#list').append('<li>'+i+'</li>');
  }
  ```

The above example could be quickened using `html()` and building the list beforehand: 

  ```javascript
  let list = ''; 
  for (let i=0; i<1000; i++) { 
      list += '<li>'+i+'</li>'; 
  } 

  $('#list').html(list); 
  ```

### Reconsider JQuery

Limiting your JS frameworks and using native JS whenever possible can increase the available bandwidth and lower your processing overhead. This can also limit compatibility issues with older browsers. 

For more information, see [youmightnotneedjquery.com](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) for alternative examples to functions such as JQuery's `show`, `hide`, `addClass`, and more.  

### Use canvas or WebGL 
For repeated use of animations consider using **Canvas** or **WebGL** instead of SVG. Unlike SVG, with these options performance is determined by size rather than content. 

You can read more about the differences in [SVG vs Canvas: How to Choose](/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/samples/gg193983(v=vs.85)). 

### Use requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout 
If you use [requestAnimationFrame](https://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/) to update your on-screen animations, your animation functions are called **before** the browser calls another repaint.

For more information, see this [sample](https://testdrive-archive.azurewebsites.net/Graphics/RequestAnimationFrame/Default.html) on smooth animation using `requestAnimationFrame`.
