# Use the supportsMultiVisualSelection feature

The `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature enables you to use selection in multiple visuals in a report.

## Example

In a report with more than one visual, select two values to have those values apply to other visuals. For instance, in [Retail Analysis sample](../../create-reports/sample-retail-analysis.md), select **Fashions Direct** in one visual. Select ctrl and select **Jan** in another visual. In the report, your selections apply to the other visuals that support this feature usage. Other visuals now scope to **Fashions Direct** and **Jan**.

## Requirements

This feature requires API v3.2.0 or higher.

You can't apply this feature to image visuals. You can't apply it to some advanced visuals such as key driver, decomposition tree, Q&A visuals, textbox, and gauge charts.

## Usage

To use the `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature, add the following code to the `capabilities.json` file of your visual.

```json
    {   
            ...
        "supportsMultiVisualSelection": true
            ...
    }
```
