# Use the updated ribbon in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop has revised its ribbon to better align its appearance and experience with other Microsoft products, such as Microsoft Office.

## How to enable the updated ribbon

The updated ribbon is generally available beginning with the May 2020 release of Power BI Desktop. Starting with the March 2020 update, the updated ribbon is on by default. 

## Features of the updated ribbon

The benefits of updating our ribbon are intended to make the experience across Power BI Desktop, as well as other Microsoft products, easy and familiar. 

![Screenshot shows a close up of the Power B I Desktop ribbon.](media/desktop-ribbon/desktop-ribbon-03.png)

These benefits can be grouped into the following categories:

* **Improved look, feel, and organization** - icons and functionality in the updated Power BI Desktop ribbon are aligned to the look, feel, and organization of ribbon items found in Office applications.

* **An intuitive Themes gallery** - the Themes gallery, found in the **View** ribbon, has the familiar look and feel of the PowerPoint themes gallery. As such, the images in the ribbon show you what the theme changes will look like if applied to your report, such as the color combinations and fonts.

* **Dynamic ribbon content based on your view** - in the existing ribbon for Power BI Desktop, icons or commands that weren't available were simply grayed out, creating a less-than-optimal experience. With the updated ribbon, icons are dynamically displayed and arranged, so that you always know which options are available to you, in context.

* **A single-line ribbon, when collapsed, saves you space** - another benefit of the updated ribbon is the ability to collapse the ribbon itself into a single line, dynamically displaying ribbon items based on your context.

* **Keytips to navigate and select buttons** - to help navigate the ribbon, you can press **Alt + Windows Key** to activate keytips. Once activated, you can press the shown keys on your keyboard to navigate.

* **Custom format strings** - in addition to setting custom format strings in the *Properties* pane, you can also set them in the ribbon. Select the measure or column you want to customize and a **Measure tools** or **Column tools** contextual tab appears, depending on your selection. In that tab's formatting section, you can type your custom format string directly into the dropdown box.

* **Accessibility** - the title bar, ribbon, and file menu are fully accessible. Press Ctrl + F6 to navigate to the ribbon section. Once there, you can use **Tab** to move between the top and bottom bars, and use arrow keys to move between elements.


In addition to those visible changes, an updated ribbon also lets us make future updates to Power BI Desktop, and its ribbon, such as the following:

* Create more flexible and intuitive controls in the ribbon, such as the visuals gallery
* Add the *black* and *dark gray* Office themes to Power BI Desktop
* Improve accessibility
