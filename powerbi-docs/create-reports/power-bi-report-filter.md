# Design filters in Power BI reports

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-desktop](../includes/yes-desktop.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)]

With the new filter experience, you have a lot of control over report filter design and functionality. You can format the Filters pane to look like the rest of the report. You can lock and even hide filters. When designing your report, you no longer see the old Filters pane at all in the Visualizations pane. You do all your filter editing and formatting in a single Filters pane. 

![The filter experience](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-new-look.png)

As a report designer, here are some of the tasks you can do in the new Filters pane:

- Add and remove fields to filter on. 
- Change the filter state.
- Format and customize the Filters pane so that it feels part of your report.
- Define whether the Filters pane is open or collapsed by default when a consumer opens the report.
- Hide the entire Filters pane or specific filters that you don't want report consumers to see.
- Control and even bookmark the visibility, open, and collapsed state of the Filters pane.
- Lock filters that you don't want consumers to edit.

When reading a report, users can hover over any visual to see a read-only list of all the filters or slicers affecting that visual.

Read about [how report readers use filters](../consumer/end-user-report-filter.md) in your report.

## View filters for a visual in Reading mode

In Reading mode, hover over the filter icon for a visual to see a pop-up filter list with all the filters, slicers, and so on, affecting that visual. The formatting of the pop-up filter list is the same as the Filters pane formatting.

![Filters affecting a visual](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-per-visual.png)

Here are the types of filters this view shows:

- Basic filters
- Slicers
- Cross-highlighting 
- Cross-filtering
- Advanced filters
- Top N filters
- Relative Date filters
- Sync-slicers
- Include/Exclude filters
- Filters passed through a URL

Read more about [interacting with filters in reading mode](../consumer/end-user-report-filter.md).

## Build the Filters pane

After you enable the new Filters pane, you see it to the right of the report page, formatted by default based on your current report settings. In the Filters pane, you configure which filters to include, and update existing filters. The Filters pane will look the same for your report consumers when you publish your report. 

1. By default, your report consumers can see the Filters pane. If you don't want them to see it, select the eye icon next to **Filters**.

    ![Power BI filter eye icon](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-eye-icon.png)

2. To start building your Filters pane, drag fields of interest into the Filters pane either as visual, page, or report level filters.

When you add a visual to a report canvas, Power BI automatically adds a filter to the Filters pane for each field in the visual. 

## Hide the Filters pane while editing

Power BI Desktop has a new ribbon in preview. On the **View** tab, the **Filters** toggle button allows you to show or hide the Filters pane. This feature is useful when you aren't using the Filters pane and need extra space on the screen. This addition aligns the Filters pane with the other panes that you can open and close, such as the Bookmarks and Selection panes. 

![Show or hide the Filters pane while editing](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-hide.png)

This setting only hides the Filters pane in Power BI Desktop. If you want to hide the Filters pane for your end users, you instead select the **eye** icon next to **Filters**.

![Eye icon](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-eye.png) 

## Lock or hide filters

You can lock or hide individual filter cards. If you lock a filter, your report consumers can see but not change it. If you hide it, they can't even see it. Hiding filter cards is typically useful if you need to hide data cleanup filters that exclude nulls or unexpected values. 

- In the Filters pane, select or clear the **Lock filter** or **Hide filter** icons in a filter card.

   ![Hide or lock filters](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-lock-hide.png)

As you turn these settings on and off in the Filters pane, you see the changes reflected in the report. Hidden filters don't show up in the pop-up filter list for a visual.

You can also configure the Filters pane state to flow with your report bookmarks. The pane's open, close, and visibility state are all bookmarkable.
 
## Format the Filters pane

A big part of the filter experience is that you can format the Filters pane to match the look and feel of your report. You can also format the Filters pane differently for each page in the report. Here are elements you can format: 

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border on or off
- Border color
- Title and header font, color, and text size

You can also format these elements for filter cards, depending on if they're applied (set to something) or available (cleared): 

- Background color
- Background transparency
- Border: on or off
- Border color
- Font, color, and text size
- Input box color

### Format the Filters pane and cards

1. In the report, click the report itself, or the background (*wallpaper*), then in the **Visualizations** pane, select **Format**. 
    You see options for formatting the report page, the wallpaper, and also the Filters pane and Filter cards.

1. Expand **Filters pane** to set color for the background, icon, and left border, to complement the report page.

    ![Expand Filters pane](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-format-filter-pane.png)

1. Expand **Filter cards** to set the **Available** and **Applied** color and border. If you make available and applied cards different colors, it's obvious which filters are applied.

## Theming for Filters pane
You can now modify the default settings of the Filters pane with the theme file. Here's a sample theme snippet to get you started:

 
```
"outspacePane": [{ 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#0000ff"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#00ff00"}}, 

"transparency": 50, 

"titleSize": 35, 

"headerSize": 8, 

"fontFamily": "Georgia", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ff0000"}} 

}], 

"filterCard": [ 

{ 

"$id": "Applied", 

"transparency": 0, 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ff0000"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#45f442"}}, 

"textSize": 30, 

"fontFamily": "Arial", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ffffff"}}, 

"inputBoxColor": {"solid": {"color": "#C8C8C8"}} 

}, 

{ 

"$id": "Available", 

"transparency": 40, 

"backgroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#00ff00"}}, 

"foregroundColor": {"solid": {"color": "#ffffff"}}, 

"textSize": 10, 

"fontFamily": "Times New Roman", 

"border": true, 

"borderColor": {"solid": {"color": "#123456"}}, 

"inputBoxColor": {"solid": {"color": "#777777"}} 

}] 
```

## Sort the Filters pane

Custom sort functionality is available in the Filters pane. When creating your report, you can drag and drop filters to rearrange them in any order.

![Rearrange filter sort order](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-sort.gif)

The default sort order is alphabetical for filters. To start custom sort mode, just drag any filter to a new position. You can only sort filters within the level they apply to -- for example, a visual-level, page-level, or report-level filter.

## Improved Filters pane accessibility

We've improved the keyboard navigation for the Filters pane. You can tab through every part of the Filters pane and use the context key on your keyboard or Shift+F10 to open the context menu.

![Filters pane accessibility](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-accessible.png)

## Rename filters
When you're editing the Filters pane, you can double-click the title to edit it. Renaming is useful if you want to update the filter card to make more sense for your end users. Keep in mind renaming the filter card does *not* rename the display name of the field in the fields list. It just changes the display name used in the filter card.

![Rename a filter](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-rename.png)

## Filters pane search

The Filters pane search feature allows you to search across your filter cards by title. This feature is helpful if you have several different filter cards in your Filters pane and need help finding the ones of interest.

![Search for a filter](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-search.png)

You can also format the search box, just as you can format the other elements of the Filters pane.

![Format the search box](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-filter-format-search.png)

While this Filters pane search feature is on by default, you can also choose to turn it on or off by selecting **Enable search for Filters pane** in the **Report** settings of the **Options** dialog.

![Turn search on or off](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-enable-search-filter.png)

## Restrict changes to filter type

Under the **Filtering experience** section of **Report** settings, you have an option to control if users can change the filter type.

![Restrict changing filter type](media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-enable-change-filter-type.png)

## Allow saving filters

By default, your report readers can save filters for your report. You can choose to not allow them to save filters.

- Also in **Report** settings of the **Options** dialog, under **Persistent filters**, select **Don't allow end users to save filters on this report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/power-bi-persistent-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Don't allow end users to save filters on this report.":::

## Apply filters button

You can add a single **Apply** button to the filter pane, allowing you and your end-users to apply all filter modifications at once. Having this button can be useful if you want to defer applying filter changes. You only have to wait once, after you're ready to apply all the filter changes to the report or visuals.

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/apply-filter-button.png" alt-text="Apply filter button":::

### Turn on the Apply button

You can set this feature at the report level. However, the feature is off by default.

1. Go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Query reduction**.

1. Select **Add a single Apply button to the filter pane to apply changes at once**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-report-filter/apply-all-filters.png" alt-text="Turn on Apply filter button":::

### Format the Apply button

Currently, you can control some of the formatting for the **Apply** text for the button. In the **Filter pane** section of the **Format** pane, set these options:

- **Checkbox and Apply color** controls fill color. 
- **Font and icon color** controls text color.
- **Header text size** controls text size.
- **Font family** controls font.

## Considerations and limitations

Publish-to-web doesn't display the Filters pane. If you're planning to publish a report to the web, consider adding slicers for filtering.
