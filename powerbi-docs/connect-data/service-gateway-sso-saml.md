# Use Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) for SSO from Power BI to on-premises data sources

Enabling SSO makes it easy for Power BI reports and dashboards to refresh data from on-premises sources while respecting user-level permissions configured on those sources. Use [Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)](https://www.onelogin.com/pages/saml) to enable seamless single sign-on connectivity. 

## Supported data sources

We currently support SAP HANA with SAML. For more information about setting up and configuring single sign-on for SAP HANA by using SAML, see [SAML SSO for BI Platform to HANA](https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/SAPHANA/SAML+SSO+for+BI+Platform+to+HANA).

We support additional data sources with [Kerberos](service-gateway-sso-kerberos.md) (including SAP HANA).

For SAP HANA, it's recommended you enable encryption before you establish a SAML SSO connection. To enable encryption, configure the HANA server to accept encrypted connections and configure the gateway to use encryption to communicate with your HANA server. Because the HANA ODBC driver doesn't encrypt SAML assertions by default, the signed SAML assertion is sent from the gateway to the HANA server *in the clear* and is vulnerable to interception and reuse by third parties.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SAP no longer supports the OpenSSL, and as a result, Microsoft also has discontinued its support. Existing and new connections will continue to work properly until the end of 2020, but will not work from January 1, 2021 onwards. Use CommonCryptoLib instead.

## Configuring the gateway and data source

To use SAML, you must establish a trust relationship between the HANA servers for which you want to enable SSO and the gateway. In this scenario, the gateway serves as the SAML Identity Provider (IdP). There are various ways to establish this relationship. SAP recommends you use the SAP Cryptographic Library (also known as CommonCryptoLib or sapcrypto) to complete the setup steps in which we establish the trust relationship. For more information, see the official SAP documentation.

The following steps describe how to establish a trust relationship between a HANA server and the gateway IdP by signing the gateway IdP's X509 certificate with a Root CA trusted by the HANA server. 

### Create the certificates

Take the following steps to create the certificates:

1. On the device that is running SAP HANA, create an empty folder to store your certificates, then navigate to that folder.
2. Create the root certificates by running the following command:

   ```
   openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -sha256 -keyout CA_Key.pem -out CA_Cert.pem -extensions v3_ca'''
   ```

    You must remember the passphrase to use this certificate to sign other certificates.
    You should see *CA_Cert.pem* and *CA_Key.pem* being created.

   
3. Create the IdP certificates by running the following command:
 
    ```
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -sha256 -keyout IdP_Key.pem -out IdP_Req.pem -nodes
    ```
    You should see *IdP_Key.pem* and *IdP_Req.pem* being created.

4. Sign the IdP Certificates with the root certificates:

    ```
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in IdP_Req.pem -sha256 -extensions usr_cert -CA CA_Cert.pem -CAkey CA_Key.pem -CAcreateserial -out IdP_Cert.pem
    ```
    You should see *CA_Cert.srl* and *IdP_Cert.pem* being created.
    We are only concerned about the *IdP_Cert.pem*.    

### Create SAML identity provider certificate mapping

Create the SAML Identity Provider certificate mapping with the following steps.

1. In **SAP HANA Studio**, right-click your SAP HANA server name then navigate to **Security > Open Security Console > SAML Identity Provider**.
2. If the SAP Cryptographic Library is not selected, select it. Do *not* use the OpenSSL Cryptographic Library (the selection on the left, in the following image), it is deprecated by SAP.

    ![Select the SAP Cryptographic Library](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-01.png)

3. Import the signed certificate *IdP_Cert.pem* by clicking the blue import button, shown in the following image.

    ![Select the blue import button](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-02.png)

Remember to assign a name to your *Identity Provider Name*.

### Import and create the signed certificates in HANA

Next, you'll import and create the signed certificates in HANA. Follow these steps:

1. In **HANA Studio**, run the following query:

    ```
    CREATE CERTIFICATE FROM '<idp_cert_pem_certificate_content>'
    ```
    
    Here's an example:

    ```
    CREATE CERTIFICATE FROM
    '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIDyDCCArCgA...veryLongString...0WkC5deeawTyMje6
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    '
    ```

2. If there is no PSEwith SAML Purpose, create one by running the following query in **HANA Studio**:
    
    ```
    CREATE PSE SAMLCOLLECTION;<br>set pse SAMLCOLLECTION purpose SAML;<br>
    ```

3. Add the newly created signed certificate to the PSE with the following command:

    ```
    alter pse SAMLCOLLECTION add CERTIFICATE <certificate_id>;
    ```

    For example:
    ```
    alter pse SAMLCOLLECTION add CERTIFICATE 1978320;
    ```

    You can check the list of certificated created with the following query:
    ```
    select * from PUBLIC"."CERTIFICATES"
    ```

    The certificate is now properly installed. You can run the following query to confirm:
    ```
    select * from "PUBLIC"."PSE_CERTIFICATES"
    ```

### Map the user

Follow these steps to map the user:

1. In **SAP HANA Studio**, select the **Security** folder:

    ![Select the Security folder](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-03.png)

2. Expand **Users**, and then select the user to whom you want to map your Power BI user.

3. Select the **SAML** checkbox, and then select **Configure**, shown highlighted in the following image.

    ![Select SAML then the Configure link](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-04.png)

4. Select the identity provider you created in the [create SAML identity provider certificate mapping](#create-saml-identity-provider-certificate-mapping) section, earlier in this article. For External Identity, enter the Power BI user's UPN (typically the email address the user uses to sign in to Power BI), and then select **Add**.  The following image shows the options and selections.

    ![Configure SAML identities window](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-05.png)

    If you've configured your gateway to use the *ADUserNameReplacementProperty* configuration option, enter the value that will replace the Power BI user's original UPN. For example, if you set *ADUserNameReplacementProperty* to *SAMAccountName* enter the user's *SAMAccountName*.

### Configure the gateway

Now that you have the gateway's certificate and identity configured, convert the certificate to a pfx format and configure the gateway to use the certificate with the following steps.

1. Convert the certificate to pfx format by running the following command. This command names the resulting .pfx file samlcert.pfx and sets *root* as its password:

    ```
    openssl pkcs12 -export -out samltest.pfx -in IdP_Cert.pem -inkey IdP_Key.pem -passin pass:root -passout pass:root
    ```

2. Copy the pfx file to the gateway machine:

    1. Double-click *samltest.pfx*, then select **Local Machine** > **Next**.

    2. Enter the password, then select **Next**.

    3. Select **Place all certificates in the following store,** then select **Browse** > **Personal** > **OK**.

    4. Select **Next**, and then **Finish**.

       ![Import certificate](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/service-gateway-sso-saml-06.png)

3. Grant the gateway service account access to the private key of the certificate, with the following steps:

    1. On the gateway machine, run the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

        ![Run MMC](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/run-mmc.png)

    2. Under **File**, select **Add/Remove Snap-in**.

        ![Add snap-in](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/add-snap-in.png)

    3. Select **Certificates** > **Add**, then select **Computer account** > **Next**.

    4. Select **Local Computer** > **Finish** > **OK**.

    5. Expand **Certificates** > **Personal** > **Certificates**, and find the certificate.

    6. Right-click the certificate and navigate to **All Tasks** &gt; **Manage Private Keys**.

        ![Manage private keys](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/manage-private-keys.png)

    1. Add the gateway service account to the list. By default, the account is **NT SERVICE\PBIEgwService**. You can find out which account is running the Gateway service by running **services.msc** and locating **On-premises data gateway service**.

        ![Gateway service](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/gateway-service.png)

Finally, follow these steps to add the certificate thumbprint to the gateway configuration:

1. Run the following PowerShell command to list the certificates on your machine:

    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -path cert:\LocalMachine\My
    ```

2. Copy the thumbprint for the certificate you created.

3. Navigate to the gateway directory, which by default is *C:\Program Files\On-premises data gateway*.

4. Open *PowerBI.DataMovement.Pipeline.GatewayCore.dll.config*, and find the *SapHanaSAMLCertThumbprint* section. Paste the thumbprint you copied.

5. Restart the gateway service.

## Running a Power BI report

Now you can use the **Manage Gateway** page in Power BI to configure the SAP HANA data source. Under **Advanced Settings**, enable SSO via SAML. Doing so allows you to publish reports and datasets binding to that data source.

   ![Advanced settings](media/service-gateway-sso-saml/advanced-settings.png)

## Troubleshooting

After you configure SAML-based SSO, you might see the following error in the Power BI portal: *The credentials provided cannot be used for the SapHana source.* This error indicates that the SAML credential was rejected by SAP HANA.

Server-side authentication traces provide detailed information for troubleshooting credential issues on SAP HANA. Follow these steps to configure tracing for your SAP HANA server:

1. On the SAP HANA server, turn on the authentication trace by running the following query:

    ```
    ALTER SYSTEM ALTER CONFIGURATION ('indexserver.ini', 'SYSTEM') set ('trace', 'authentication') = 'debug' with reconfigure 
    ```

1. Reproduce the issue.

1. In HANA Studio, open the administration console, and select the **Diagnosis Files** tab.

1. Open the latest index server trace and search for *SAMLAuthenticator.cpp*.

    You should find a detailed error message that indicates the root cause, for example:

    ```
    [3957]{-1}[-1/-1] 2018-09-11 21:40:23.815797 d Authentication   SAMLAuthenticator.cpp(00091) : Element '{urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion}Assertion', attribute 'ID': '123123123123123' is not a valid value of the atomic type 'xs:ID'.
    [3957]{-1}[-1/-1] 2018-09-11 21:40:23.815914 i Authentication   SAMLAuthenticator.cpp(00403) : No valid SAML Assertion or SAML Protocol detected
    ```

1. After the troubleshooting is complete, turn off the authentication trace by running the following query:

    ```
    ALTER SYSTEM ALTER CONFIGURATION ('indexserver.ini', 'SYSTEM') UNSET ('trace', 'authentication');
    ```
