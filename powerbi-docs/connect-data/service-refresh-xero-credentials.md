# How to refresh your Xero content pack credentials if refresh failed
If you use the Xero Power BI content pack, you may have experienced some problems with the content pack’s daily refresh due to a recent Power BI service incident.

You can see if your content pack refreshed successfully by checking the last refresh status for your Xero dataset as shown in the screenshot below.
