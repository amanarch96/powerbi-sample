The dashboard shows emergency managers aggregate data across their health system to help them to make timely, correct decisions.

This article tells  you how to install the app and how to connect to the data sources. For more information about the Crisis Communication app, see [Set up and learn about the Crisis Communication sample template in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/sample-crisis-communication-app)
