# Connect to the Regional Emergency Response Dashboard
The Regional Emergency Response Dashboard is the reporting component of the [Microsoft Power Platform Regional Emergency Response solution](/powerapps/sample-apps/regional-emergency-response/overview). Regional organization admins can view the dashboard in their Power BI tenant, enabling them to quickly view important data and metrics that will help them make efficient decisions.

This article tells  you how to install the Regional Emergency Response app using the Regional Emergency Response Dashboard template app, and how to connect to the data sources.
