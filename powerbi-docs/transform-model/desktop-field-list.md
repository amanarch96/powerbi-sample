# Using the Field list in Power BI Desktop (preview)

Beginning with the November 2020 update, we are unifying the **Field** lists across Model view, Data view and Report view in Power BI Desktop. Unifying these views will create consistency for functionality and the user interface (UI) across views, and addresses customer feedback.

Changes you’ll notice across views include the following:

* Iconography
* Search functionality
* Context menu items
* Similar drag-drop behavior
* Tooltips
* Accessibility improvements

The intent is to improve Power BI Desktop usability. The changes should have minimal impact on your typical data workflow.

## Enabling the new Field list (preview)

The unified Field list begins with **Model** view, and subsequently will be enabled for other views. To enable the unified Field view, in Power BI Desktop navigate to **File > Options and settings > Options** and then select **Preview features** from the left pane. In the Preview features section, select the checkbox beside **New field list**.

You'll be prompted to restart Power BI Desktop for the selection to take effect.

The following tables show the field list updates.

There are new Field list icons as well. The following table shows the original icons and their new equivalent, and provides a brief description of each.

Aggregates are imported with the data and defined in the data model your report is based on. For more information, see [Aggregates in Power BI reports](../create-reports/service-aggregates.md).         |
|![original calculated column icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-07a.png)     |![new calculated column icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-07b.png)         |Calculated column with a non-numeric data type: A new non-numeric column you create with a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula that defines the column’s values. Read more about [calculated columns](desktop-calculated-columns.md).        |
|![original numeric calculated column icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-08a.png)     |![new numeric calculated column icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-08b.png)          |Numeric calculated column: A new column you create with a Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) formula that defines the column’s values.

|![original measure icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-09a.png)     |![new measure icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-09b.png)          |Measure: A measure has its own hard-coded formula. Report viewers can’t change the calculation, for example, if it’s a sum, it can only be a sum. The values aren't stored in a column. They're calculated on the fly, depending solely on their location in a visual. For more information, read [Understanding measures](desktop-measures.md).         |
|![original measure group icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-10a.png)     |![new measure group icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-10b.png)         |Measure group.         |

|![original identity field icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-14a.png)     |![new identity field icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-14b.png)          |Identity field: Fields with this icon are unique fields, set to show all values, even if they have duplicates. For example, your data might have records for two different people named 'Robin Smith', and each will be treated as unique. They won't be summed.         |
|![original parameter icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-15a.png)     |![new parameter icon](media/desktop-field-list/field-list-15b.png)          |Parameter: Set parameters to make parts of your reports and data models (such as a query filter, a data source reference, a measure definition, etc.) depend on one or more parameter values.

These are best used for intermediate calculations and you want to store as part of the model.         |
