In this article, you learn how to create the .rdl for a Power BI paginated report by downloading from a shared dataset in the Power BI service. Paginated reports have the file format *.rdl*. You can create an .rdl file directly from a  dataset in the Power BI service.

1. Go to list view for any workspace, including My Workspace. 
1. Select **More options (...)** for a dataset, then select **Download the .rdl**.

1. Go through the Power BI Report Builder installation process: 

    1. Select **Download**.  
    2. Select **Open file** and go through the steps in the Power BI Report Builder Setup Wizard.

    The design surface also features a link to the [Power BI Paginated Reports in a Day](../learning-catalog/paginated-reports-online-course.md) video-based course. If you're new to paginated report creation, the course is a good way to get up to speed.  You can delete it when you start designing your report.

    You're ready to start designing your paginated report.
