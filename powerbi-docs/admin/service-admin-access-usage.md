# Find Power BI users that have signed in

If you're an admin for your organization, and want to see who has signed into Power BI, use the [Azure Active Directory access and usage reports](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-sign-ins).

> [!NOTE]
> The **Sign-ins** report provides useful info, but it doesn't identify the type of license for each user. Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to view licenses.

## Requirements

Any user can view a report of their own sign-ins. To see a report for all users you must be in one of the following roles: Global Admin, Security Admin, Security Reader, Global Reader, or Report Reader.

## Use the Azure Active Directory admin center to view sign-ins

To view sign-in activity, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com), then select **Azure Active Directory** from the portal menu.

1. From the resource menu, select **Monitoring** > **Sign-ins**.

1. By default, all sign-ins from the last 24 hours for all users and all applications are shown. To select a different time period, select **Date** in the working pane and choose from the available time intervals. Only info from the last seven days is available. To see only sign-ins to Power BI, add filters. Select **Add filter** > pick **Application** as the field to filter by, and select **Apply**. Select **Application starts with** from the top of the working pane, and enter the app name. Select **Apply**.

    **Microsoft Power BI** filters to sign-in activity related to the service. **Power BI Gateway** filters to sign-in activity specific to the on-premises data gateway.

## Export the data

You can [download a sign-in report](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/quickstart-download-sign-in-report) in either of two formats: a CSV file, or a JSON file.

1. From the command bar for the **Sign-ins** report, select **Download** and then select one of the following options:

   * **CSV** to download a CSV file for the currently filtered data.

   * **JSON** to download a JSON file for the currently filtered data.

2. Type a file name, then select **Download**.

## Data retention

Sign-in-related data is available for up to seven days, unless your organization has an Azure AD premium license. If you're using Azure AD Premium P1 or Azure AD Premium P2, you can see data for the past 30 days. For more info, see [Azure Active Directory report retention policies](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-data-retention).
