# How to apply sensitivity labels in Power BI

Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels on your reports, dashboards, datasets, and dataflows can guard your sensitive content against unauthorized data access and leakage. Labeling your data correctly with sensitivity labels ensures that only authorized people can access your data. This article shows you how to apply sensitivity labels to your content.

To be able to apply sensitivity labels in Power BI:
* You must have a Power BI Pro license and edit permissions on the content you wish to label.
* You must belong to a security group that has permissions to apply sensitivity labels, as described in the article entitled [Enable sensitivity labels in Power BI](./service-security-enable-data-sensitivity-labels.md).
* All [licensing and other requirements](./service-security-enable-data-sensitivity-labels.md#licensing-and-requirements) must have been met.

For more information about sensitivity labels in Power BI, see [Sensitivity labels in Power BI](service-security-sensitivity-label-overview.md).

## Applying sensitivity labels

When data protection is enabled on your tenant, sensitivity labels appear in the sensitivity column in the list view of dashboards, reports, datasets, and dataflows.
