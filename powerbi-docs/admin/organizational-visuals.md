# Manage Power BI visuals admin settings

As a Power BI admin for your organization, you can control which type of Power BI visuals users can access across the organization.

To manage Power BI visuals, you must be a Global Admin in Office 365, or have been assigned the Power BI service administrator role. For more information about the Power BI service administrator role, see [Understanding the Power BI admin role](service-admin-role.md).

## Access the admin portal

To enable the settings described in the article, you'll need to access the admin portal.

1. In Power BI service, select **Settings**.

2. From the settings drop-down menu, select **Admin portal**.

## Power BI visuals tenant settings

As a Power BI admin for your organization, you can control which type of Power BI visuals users will be able to access across the organization.

The UI tenant settings only affect Power BI service. If you want these settings to take effect in Power BI Desktop, use group policies. A table at the end of each section provides details for enabling the setting in Power BI Desktop.

>[!NOTE]
>Changes to tenant settings do not affect Power BI visuals listed in the [organizational visuals](#organizational-visuals) tab.

### Visuals from AppSource or a file

Manage organizational access for the following type of Power BI visuals:

* Visuals created by developers and saved as a .pbiviz file.

* Visuals available from AppSource.

Follow the instructions below to enable users in your organization upload .pbiviz files, and add visuals from AppSource to their reports and dashboards.

1. Expand the **Allow visuals created using the Power BI SDK** settings.

2. Click **Enabled**.

3. Choose who can upload .pbiviz and AppSource visuals:

    * Select **The entire organization** option to allow everyone in your organization to upload .pbiviz files, and add visuals from AppSource.

     * Select the **Specific security groups** option to manage uploading .pbiviz files, and adding visuals from AppSource using security groups. Add the security groups you want to manage to the *Enter security groups* text bar. The security groups you specified are excluded by default. If you want to include these security groups and exclude everyone else in the organization, select the **Except specific security groups** option.

4. Click **Apply**.

![visuals from file or AppSource](media/organizational-visuals/tenant-settings.png)

UI changes to tenant settings apply only to Power BI service. To enable users in your organization upload .pbiviz files, and add visuals from AppSource to their visualization pane in  Power BI Desktop, use [Azure AD Group Policy](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/manage-group-policy).

|Key  |Value name  |Value  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Software\Policies\Microsoft\Power BI Desktop\    |EnableCustomVisuals    |0 - Disable </br>1 - Enable (default)         |
|

### Certified Power BI visuals

When this setting is enabled, only [certified Power BI visuals](../developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md) will render in your organization's reports and dashboards. Power BI visuals from AppSource or files, that are not certified, will return an error message.

1. From the admin portal, select **Add and use certified visuals only**.

2. Click **Enabled**.

3. Click **Apply**.

![certified visuals](media/organizational-visuals/certified-visuals.png)

UI changes to tenant settings apply only to Power BI service. To manage the certified visuals tenant setting in Power BI Desktop, use [Azure AD Group Policy](/azure/active-directory-domain-services/manage-group-policy).

|Key  |Value name  |Value  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Software\Policies\Microsoft\Power BI Desktop\    |EnableUncertifiedVisuals    |0 - Disable </br>1 - Enable (default)         |
|

## Organizational visuals

As a Power BI admin, you can manage the list of Power BI visuals available in your organization's [organizational store](../developer/visuals/power-bi-custom-visuals.md#organizational-store). The **Organizational visuals** tab in the *Admin portal*, allows you to add and remove visuals, and decide which visuals will automatically display in the visualization pane of your organization's users. You can add to the list any type of visual including uncertified visuals and .pbiviz visuals, even if they contradict the [tenant settings](#power-bi-visuals-tenant-settings) of your organization.

Organizational visuals settings are automatically deployed to Power BI Desktop.

>[!NOTE]
>Organizational visuals are not supported in Power BI Report Server.
