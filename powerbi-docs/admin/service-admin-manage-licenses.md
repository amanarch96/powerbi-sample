# View and manage Power BI user licenses

This article explains how admins can use the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Azure portal to view and manage user licenses for the Power BI service.

> [!NOTE]
>
>It's possible for a user to have both a Power BI (free) and a Power BI Pro license assigned. This can happen when a user signs up for a free license and then is later assigned a Power BI Pro license. The highest licensing level takes effect in this case.
