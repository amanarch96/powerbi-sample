# Frequently asked questions about Power BI

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynnn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynnn.md)]

* If you have other questions, [try asking the Power BI Community](https://community.powerbi.com/).
* Still have an issue? Visit the [Power BI support page](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/support/).

## What is the Microsoft Power BI service?

The Power BI service is a cloud-based business analytics service that enables anyone to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a broad range of cloud-based and on-premises data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life. Read more about [Power BI](../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md).

## What is a Power BI *business user*?

The way you interact with Power BI will depend on your job role. As an end user or *business user*, you are the person who receives content (dashboards, reports, and apps) from colleagues. You work in the online or mobile version of Power BI, which is called the Power BI service, reviewing and interacting with this content, to make business decisions.  Read more about [Power BI for business users](index.yml).


## What's the difference between Power BI Pro and Power BI Premium?

Power BI Pro is an individual user license that allows access to all content and capabilities in the Power BI service. You can even share content and collaborate with other Pro users. Only Pro users can publish content to other workspaces, share dashboards, and subscribe to dashboards and reports. 

Power BI Premium provides a capacity to deliver more consistent performance. It also supports larger data volumes in Power BI. For individual users, Premium enables widespread distribution of content by Pro users and it doesn't require per-user Pro licenses for recipients viewing the content. This means that *business users* can collaborate with colleagues and view and interact with dashboards, reports, and apps that have been shared with them. 

To learn more, see [What type of license do I have?](end-user-license.md).

## What if I have questions about Power BI Premium?

For questions related to Power BI Premium, see [Power BI Premium FAQ](../admin/service-premium-faq.md).

## What is Power BI Desktop?

Power BI Desktop is a free application you can install right on your own computer. Power BI Desktop works cohesively with the Power BI service.  Data scientists, report designers, admins, and developers work with Power BI Desktop to produce reports and make them available to the Power BI service *business users*, like you. Read more about [What is Power BI Desktop](../fundamentals/desktop-what-is-desktop.md).

## As a *business user*, what do I need to use the Power BI service?

If your company has purchased Power BI licenses or a Premium capacity account, all you'll need is a Web browser and credentials. To log in, you'll use your work email address and a password (set by your Power BI administrator).  

You can also sign up for the Power BI service as an individual. See [the Power BI self-service sign-up process](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md)

## Why do I have to sign up with my work email?
