# Add spotlights to Power BI reports

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

With spotlight, you can draw attention to a specific visual on a report page.  If the spotlight mode is selected when you add a bookmark, that mode is retained in the bookmark.

## Add a spotlight

1. [Open a report](end-user-report-open.md) in the Power BI service.

2. Decide which visual you'd like to highlight on the report page. Select the **More actions (...)** dropdown.

3. Choose the option for **Spotlight**. The selected visual is highlighted, which causes all other visuals on the page to fade to near transparency.
