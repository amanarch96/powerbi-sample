### What's translated
Power BI translates menus, buttons, messages, and other elements of the experience into your language. For example, Power BI translates report content such as automatically generated titles, filters, and tooltips. However, your data isn't automatically translated. Inside reports, the layout of visuals doesn't change if you're using a right-to-left language such as Hebrew.

At this time, a few features are available in English only:

* Dashboards and reports that Power BI creates when you connect to services such as Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Google Analytics, and Salesforce. You can still create your own dashboards and reports in your own language.
* Exploring your data with Q&A.

Stay tuned as we work to bring additional features to other languages. 

### Choose your language in the Power BI service
1. In the Power BI service, select the **Settings** icon ![Screenshot of Power B I service showing Settings icon.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/pbi_settings_icon.png) > **Settings**.

3. Select your language > **Apply**.

### Choose your language in the browser

   You may need to close and reopen your browser to see the change.

## Choose the language or locale of Power BI Desktop
You have two ways of getting Power BI Desktop: You can download it as a standalone installer, or install it from the Windows Store.

* When you install Power BI Desktop from the Windows Store, it installs all the languages and by default shows the language that corresponds to the Windows default language.
* When you download Power BI Desktop as a standalone installer, you choose the default language when you run the installer. You can change it at a later date.
* You can also [choose a locale to be used when importing data](#choose-the-locale-for-importing-data-into-power-bi-desktop) for a specific report.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're installing the version of Power BI Desktop that's optimized for Power BI Report Server, you choose the language when you download. See [Install Power BI Desktop optimized for Power BI Report Server](../report-server/install-powerbi-desktop.md) for details.

### Choose a language for Power BI Desktop 
1. Install Power BI Desktop [from the Windows Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore), or as a [standalone installer](https://aka.ms/pbiSingleInstaller).
2. To change the language, on the Windows menu select **Settings**

3. In **Windows Settings**, select **Time & language**.
   
     ![Screenshot of Power B I Desktop showing the Windows settings dialog box.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-service-windows-settings.png)
4. Select **Language** and select a language. Select **Add a Windows display language in Microsoft Store** if necessary.
   
     ![Screenshot of Power B I Desktop showing the Windows language settings dialog box.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-service-language-settings.png)
   
     The next time you start Power BI Desktop it will use the language you set as the default. 

To override the default and use Power BI Desktop in a language other than your Windows language do the following.
1. In Power BI Desktop, go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options**.
2. Under **Global Settings**, select **Regional Settings**.
3. In the **Application Language** box, select a different locale. 

Language support in Power BI Desktop is limited to the languages displayed in the Application Language dropdown.

### Verify Power BI Desktop default number and date formatting

Power BI Desktop gets its default number and date formatting from the Windows Region settings. You can check or change those settings, if needed.

1. On the Windows menu select **Settings**

2. In **Windows Settings**, select **Time & language**.
   
     ![Screenshot of Power B I Desktop showing the Windows settings dialog box.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-service-windows-settings.png)

3. Select **Region** > **Additional date, time, and regional settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-service-region-settings.png" alt-text="Additional date, time, and regional settings":::

4. In **Clock and Region**, select **Change date, time, or number formats**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-service-check-region-settings.png" alt-text="Clock and region settings":::

5. Make sure **Match Windows display language** is selected, or change it if necessary.

### Choose the locale for importing data into Power BI Desktop
Whether you download Power BI Desktop or install it from the Windows Store, you can choose a locale for a specific report to be something other than the locale in your version of Power BI Desktop. The locale changes the way Power BI interprets data when it's imported from your data source. For example, is "3/4/2017" interpreted as 3 April or March 4?

1. In Power BI Desktop, go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options**.
2. Under **Current file**, select **Regional Settings**.
3. In the **Locale for import** box, select a different locale. 
   
   ![Screenshot of Power B I Desktop showing the Options dialog box.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi_supptdlangs-locale.png)
4. Select **OK**.

### Choose the language for the model in Power BI Desktop

Besides setting the language for the Power BI Desktop application, you can also set the model language. The model language affects chiefly two things:

- How we compare and sort strings. For example, because Turkish has two of the letter i, depending on the collation of your database, the two can end up in different orders when sorting. 
- The language Power BI Desktop uses when creating hidden date tables from date fields. For example, fields are called Month/Monat/Mois, and so on.

> [!NOTE]
> The Power BI model currently uses a locale that is not case-sensitive (or kana-sensitive) so "ABC" and "abc" will be treated as equivalent. If "ABC" is loaded into the database first, other strings that differ only by case such as "Abc" won't be loaded as a separate value.

Here's how to set the model language.

1. In Power BI Desktop, go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options**.
2. Under **Global**, select **Regional Settings**.
3. In the **Model language** box, select a different language. 

    ![Screenshot of Power B I Desktop showing how to set the model language.](media/supported-languages-countries-regions/power-bi-supported-model-languages.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Once created, the language of a Power BI model can't be changed.
