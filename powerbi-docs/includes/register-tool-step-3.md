3. In *Step 1 - sign in to Power BI*, sign in with a user that belongs to your Power BI tenant. The Azure AD app will be registered under this user.

    If you're already signed in, verify that you're signed in with the user you want to use for creating the Azure AD app. To change a user, select the *sign out* link and once the tool restarts, sign in again.
