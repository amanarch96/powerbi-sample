## Step 2 - Create an Azure AD security group

Your service principal doesn't have access to any of your Power BI content and APIs. To give the service principal access, create a security group in Azure AD, and add the service principal you created to that security group.

There are two ways to create an Azure AD security group:
* Manually (in Azure)
* Using PowerShell

### Create a security group manually

To create an Azure security group manually, follow the instructions in the [Create a basic group and add members using Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-groups-create-azure-portal) article. 

### Create a security group using PowerShell

Below is a sample script for creating a new security group, and adding an app to that security group.

>[!NOTE]
>If you want to enable service principal access for the entire organization, skip this step.

```powershell
# Required to sign in as admin
Connect-AzureAD

# Create an Azure AD security group
$group = New-AzureADGroup -DisplayName <Group display name> -SecurityEnabled $true -MailEnabled $false -MailNickName notSet

# Add the service principal to the group
Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $($group.ObjectId) -RefObjectId $($sp.ObjectId)
```

## Step 3 - Enable the Power BI service admin settings

For an Azure AD app to be able to access the Power BI content and APIs, a Power BI admin needs to enable service principal access in the Power BI admin portal.

Add the security group you created in Azure AD, to the specific security group section in the **Developer settings**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Service principals have access to any tenant settings they're enabled for. Depending on your admin settings, this includes specific security groups or the entire organization.
>
>To restrict service principal access to specific tenant settings, allow access only to specific security groups. Alternatively, you can create a dedicated security group for service principals, and exclude it from the desired tenant settings.

## Step 4 - Add the service principal to your workspace

To enable your Azure AD app access artifacts such as reports, dashboards and datasets in the Power BI service, add the service principal entity as a member or admin to your workspace.

>[!NOTE]
>This section provides UI instructions. You can also add a service principal to a workspace using the [Groups - add group user API](/rest/api/power-bi/groups/addgroupuser).

1. Scroll to the workspace you want to enable access for, and from the **More** menu, select **Workspace access**.

2. Add the service principal as an **Admin** or **Member** to the workspace.
