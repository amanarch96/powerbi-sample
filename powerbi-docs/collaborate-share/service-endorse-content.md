# Endorse your content

Power BI provides two ways you can endorse your valuable, high-quality content to increase its visibility: **promotion** and **certification**.

* **Promotion**: Promotion is a way to highlight content you think is valuable and worthwhile for others to use. It encourages the collaborative use and spread of content within an organization.

    Any content owner, as well as any member with write permissions on the workspace where the content is located, can promote the content when they think it's good enough for sharing.

* **Certification**: Certification means that the content meets the organization's quality standards and can be regarded as reliable, authoritative, and ready for use across the organization.

    Only authorized reviewers can certify content. Content owners who wish to see their content certified and are not authorized to certify it themselves must follow their organization's guidelines about getting their content certified.

Currently it is possible to endorse
* Datasets
* Dataflows (preview)
* Reports (preview)
* Apps (preview)

This article describes how to [promote content](#promote-content), how to [certify content](#certify-content) if you're an authorized reviewer, and how to [request certification](#request-content-certification) if you're not.

See [Endorsement: Promoting and certifying Power BI content](service-endorsement-overview.md) to learn more about endorsement.
